Game Choice- TIC TAC TOE
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, column, or a diagonal with either three X's or three O's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine sqaures.

The game essentially starts when you hit the start button but in reality the game starts when you place your first X or O.
Said player will begin by placing the first X or O to begin the game portion of the project.

I will mainly be using HTML,CSS, and JAVASCRIPT to make this web-based browser game. I'll mainly be focusing on my JS to improve the functionality of my game so that it will run smoothly with no bumps.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a fairly easy game based on your opponent of course but I will be trying to incoroporate and AI system in my game so that the player will have an opponent.
