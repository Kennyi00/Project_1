# Project_1
I am going to be doing the tic tac toe game using JavaScript, Html, and CSS
I'll mainly focus on the js functions to make my game run smoothly.

I'll start off with some simple HTML and CSS and work my way to the JS using different functions to make the X's and O's move around when said player moves them to the desired location.

I will need a game title displayed at the top of the page.
Player info such as- which player is X and which player is O
I will need a grid like game board for the x's and o's to go in
A win counter for best 3 out of 5
Game Status for things like whose turn it is and a message for win, lose, and draw.
Essentially laying the base for my tic-tac-toe game!
